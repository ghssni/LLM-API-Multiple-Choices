# LLM-API-Multiple-Choices
This project develops an application to generate multiple-choice questions from a story PDF using the cakra.ai LLM API. It reads the PDF content, sends it to the API, formats the responses into questions, and displays them via Streamlit. The key innovation is automating question generation from unstructured text, enhancing educational tools.
