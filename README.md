# LLM-API-Multiple-Choices
This project involves developing an application to generate multiple-choice questions from a story PDF using the cakra.ai LLM API. The process starts with loading and reading the PDF content, which is then sent to the LLM API to generate questions. The application formats these API responses into multiple-choice questions and presents them through a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit. The innovative aspect of this project lies in its seamless integration of natural language processing capabilities to automatically generate educational content from unstructured text, providing a valuable tool for educators and learners. Key considerations during development included ensuring the accuracy of question generation and maintaining a simple yet effective user experience.
